In total, Kebnekaise has
 - 602 nodes in 15 racks
 - 19288 cores (2448 of which are KNL-cores)
 - More than 136 TB memory
 - 984 TFlops/s Peak performance
 - 791 TFlops/s HPL (80% of Peak performance)  

**Storage**

 - Home directory (25GB)
 - Project storage (small, medium, large. Applied for through SUPR. Shared among project members)

Overview of projects, storage, and accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use Kebnekaise, you must be a member of a compute project. This is handled through `SUPR <https://supr.snic.se/>`_ which is why you also need an account there. 

**There are three sizes of compute projects**

 - Small

   - <= 5000 core-h/month
   - at least PhD student to apply
   - evaluated weekly
 - Medium

   - 5000 - 200000 core-h/month
   - at least assistant professor to apply
   - monthly rounds
 - Large

   - more than 200000 core-h/month
   - bi-annual rounds

Note that you can still be a member of a project even if you are not in Swedish academia. The requirements are only for the PI. 

Since the only available storage per default is the 25 GB in a user's home directory, most also needs to apply for storage. During the application for a compute project the applicant will be asked if they want the default extra storage of 500 GB. If this is not enough, it is necessary to apply for a storage project as well. 

**There are three sizes of storage project** 

 - Small

   - <= 3 TB
   - at least PhD student to apply
   - evaluated weekly
 - Medium

   - 3 - 30 TB
   - at least an assistant professor to apply
   - monthly rounds
 - Large

   - more than 30 TB
   - bi-annual rounds 

Project storage is shared among the project members. 
   
The compute project and the storage project can be linked together so members of the compute project automatically becomes members of the storage project. 

HPC2N has a webpage with more information about `projects <https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/account/project>`_.  

**Accounts**

When your project has been approved (or you have become a member of an approved project), you can apply for an account at HPC2N. This is done through SUPR, from the `account request page <https://supr.snic.se/account/>`_. 

NOTE that if you have not signed the SNIC User Agreement we will not get the account request, so remember to do this! 

You can find more information about creating accounts here: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/access-and-accounts/users 

Connecting to HPC2N's systems and transferring files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to login to HPC2N, you need an SSH client and potentially an X11 server if you want to open graphical displays. 

If you are using Windows and do not currently have a preferred setup for connecting, we recommend using ThinLinc since that includes everything needed and is quick to install. 

Guides
 - ThinLinc (all OS): https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/guides/thinlinc
 - Various SSH clients and X11 servers: 

   - Linux: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/guides/linux-connection
   - Windows: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/guides/windows-connection
   - macOS: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/guides/mac-connection   

**Password**

You get your first, temporary HPC2N password from this page: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/forms/user/suprauth?action=pwreset 

The above page can also be used to reset your HPC2N password if you have forgotten it. 

Note that you are authenticating through SUPR, using that service's login credentials! 

Logging in to Kebnekaise
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Remember, the username and password for HPC2N are separate from your SUPR credentials. 

**Linux or macOS**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh <your-hpc2n-username>@kebnekaise.hpc2n.umu.se

**Linux or macOS, using X11 forwarding** 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh -Y <your-hpc2n-username>@kebnekaise.hpc2n.umu.se

**ThinLinc** 

 - Start the ThinLinc client 
 - Enter the name of the server: kebnekaise-tl.hpc2n.umu.se and then enter your own username at HPC2N under "Username": 

.. image:: img/thinlinc-startup.png
   :width: 300pt

There are a few settings which should be changed
 - Go to "Options" -> "Security" and check that authentication method is set to password.
 - Go to "Options" -> "Screen" and uncheck "Full screen mode".
 - Enter your HPC2N password here instead of waiting for it to prompt you *as that will fail*

You can now click "Connect". You should just click "Continue" when you are being told that the server's host key is not in the registry.

After a short time, the thinlinc desktop opens, running Mate. It is fairly similar to the Gnome desktop.
All your files on HPC2N should now be available.

.. challenge::

    Login to HPC2N using ThinLinc or your SSH client of choice.

File transfers
""""""""""""""

You will often need to tranfer files between different systems, for instance between HPC2N and your own computer. There are several clients for this. 

Note that HPC2N does **not** allow regular, unsecure ftp! 

Linux
 - SCP or SFTP

.. code-block:: bash

    Using SCP. Remote (HPC2N) to local

    $ scp sourcefilename <your-hpc2n-username>@kebnekaise.hpc2n.umu.se:somedir/destfilename

    Using SCP. Local to remote (HPC2N) 

    $ scp <your-hpc2n-username@kebnekaise.hpc2n.umu.se:somedir/sourcefilename destfilename

Windows
 - Download and install client: WinSCP, FileZilla (only ftp), PSCP(PSFTP, ...
 - Transfer using SFTP or SCP

macOS
 - Transfer as for Linux, using Terminal
 - Download client: Cyberduck, Fetch, ... 

More information in the connection guides (see section under connecting to HPC2N) and on the HPC2N file transfer documentation: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/filesystems/filetransfer

Editors at HPC2N
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HPC2N has various editors installed
 - vi/vim
 - nano
 - emacs
 - ... 

Of these, **nano** is probably the easiest to use if you do not have previous experience with vim or emacs.  

Example, nano
 - nano <filename>
 - Save and exit nano: Ctrl-x

Where <filename> is either an existing file or one that you are just creating.

Example, Emacs (in terminal)
 - Start with: emacs
 - Open (or create) file: Ctrl-x Ctrl-f
 - Save: Ctrl-x Ctrl-s
 - Exit Emacs: Ctrl-x Ctrl-c

NOTE: if you want to run Emacs with full functionality in a separate window, you need to login with X11 forwarding (ssh -Y or using ThinLinc). 

**Opening a terminal window in ThinLinc**

To start a terminal window, go to the menu at the top. Click “Applications” → “System Tools” → “MATE Terminal”.

.. challenge:: 

    Try opening and editing a file using nano. Remember that you can create and open a new file directly as well. You will need to open a terminal window first if you are using ThinLinc. 

The file system at HPC2N
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you have logged in to HPC2N, you will be in your **homedirectory ($HOME)**. This is accessible to the batch system, but while you can run jobs from here it is only 25 GB.

The **project storage** is likely where you want to keep most of your data and where you will run your jobs from. The size of it depends on what type of storage project your group has. Remember that it is shared between the project group members. It is usually a good idea for each project member to create a separate subdirectory for their files. 

Other than these two places you can also use **/scratch** on both the login node and the compute nodes. NOTE however that anything you put there on the login node can disappear fairly quickly. For the compute nodes /scratch will be cleaned after the job has finished running so if you use that you will need to copy the files elsewhere before your job ends.

Project storage for this course
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The project for this course is SNIC2021-22-272. It has default storage of 500 GB, and that is located in the default location: 

.. code-block:: bash

   /proj/nobackup/snic2021-22-272/

Unless you ask for a different name for the directory when you apply for it you will get it named after the project's ID. 

It is always recommended that users create their own subdirectory in the project storage. 

.. challenge::

    Open a terminal window and change directory to the course storage project's location. Create a personal subdirectory there. 

The end of the section `Editors at HPC2N`_ describes how to open a terminal window when using ThinLinc. 

Introduction to the batch system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HPC2N uses SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) for our batch system. It is an Open Source job scheduler which provides three key functions: 
 - Keeps track of the available system resources
 - Enforces local system resource usage and scheduling policies
 - Manages a job queue, distributing work across the resources according to the policies 

Large/long/parallel jobs **must** be run through the batch system. 

In order to run a batch job, you either need to give commands to it on the command line, or **preferrably** create and submit a SLURM batch submit file/job script. 

Examples of using the batch system will be given in the "Using Kebnekaise" lecture. 

There are guides and documentation for the batch system and the policies to be found on HPC2N's website: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/support
